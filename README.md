# mbentley/bind9

docker image for bind9
based off of alpine:latest

To pull this image:
`docker pull mbentley/bind9`

Example usage, binding to all IPs on the docker host:
`docker run -d -p 53:53 -p 53:53/udp -e ENABLE_CONTROL_CHANNEL=true mbentley/bind9`

Example usage, binding to a specific IP on the docker host:
`docker run -d -p <ip-address>:53:53 -p <ip-address>:53:53/udp -e ENABLE_CONTROL_CHANNEL=true mbentley/bind9`

*Note:* By default, this image is configured to recursively answer queries from any IP.  Copy and edit one of the files in `/etc/bind` to customize the server for your needs.  Also, IPv6 is disabled by default.

Options:

* `ENABLE_CONTROL_CHANNEL` (default: false) - Set to `true` to enable the control channel, allowing the use of `rndc` to control bind
  * Note: If `rndc.key` or `rndc.conf` is available via volume, it will still be used by bind.
